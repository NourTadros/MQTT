then press next , it will take you to the next activity with a toast "Connected".
you'll have a topic field, please write the name of your topic and subscribe to it.
and test it with the cloudmqtt server , try writing the same topic name and write your message it will appear in your application
also, you can choose one switch at a time, either hi or bye then press on publish button and it will appear in your server.
if you want to switch from hi to bye, if your hi switch was on, turn it off, then turn on bye and vice versa.
