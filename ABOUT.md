I wanted to work as native not cross platforms.

I wanted to fully accomplish the application and to work correctly. So, I worked with it as a challenge as I had little knowledge about it.



First, I searched about Internet Of Things and MQTT and their purpose as it was something new. 
Then I watched tutorial of MQTT Android applications and started implementing MQTT setting it up with Android Studio. 
Testing it with "www.cloudmqtt.com". Moving to user panel, added the two switches and testing them. 
Also, I added an activity which takes the host and port number, Username and password from the user, 
checking them with cloudmqtt and subscribing to certain topic to be able to publish or receive the message.

I learned about Android Studio a lot as I had basic information about it. 
I also learned about internet of things and MQTT protocol. Therefore, I learned a lot with this experience. 
Widen my knowledge about Java. In addition, I was interested to work in application related to IOT.
